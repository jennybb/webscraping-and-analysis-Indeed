# webscraping-and-analysis-Indeed

This project focuses on two careers, Data Scientist and Business Analyst/Intelligence. Then conducts quantitative and text analysis to find out what skills are most required, years of experiences preferred, which areas will offer more chances, etc.

The dataset scraped from indeed are stored in Data.csv and Business.csv. So when doing analysis, I just simply import these two dataset to avoid running the scraper code repeatedly.

Some plotly graph cannot displayed, it's better use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to view the plot.
